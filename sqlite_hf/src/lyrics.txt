"Falling Through the Rain"  

(Verse 1)  
I see your shadow in the silence,  
Echoes of a love that used to shine.  
Every whisper feels like thunder,  
Every memory pulls me back in time.  

(Pre-Chorus)  
I reach for you, but you're fading,  
Like a dream I can't hold on to.  
I’m standing here, heart breaking,  
Wondering if you miss me too.  

(Chorus)  
I'm falling through the rain,  
Calling out your name,  
But the wind just takes my words away.  
I’m drowning in the past,  
Trying to make it last,  
But you're a ghost I can't persuade.  

(Verse 2)  
Your laughter lingers in the silence,  
A melody that plays inside my chest.  
I trace the footprints that you left here,  
But time has washed away the rest.  

(Pre-Chorus)  
I reach for you, but you're fading,  
Like a dream I can't hold on to.  
I’m standing here, heart breaking,  
Wondering if you feel it too.  

(Chorus)  
I'm falling through the rain,  
Calling out your name,  
But the wind just takes my words away.  
I’m drowning in the past,  
Trying to make it last,  
But you're a ghost I can't persuade.  

(Bridge)  
If I could turn back time,  
I'd hold you a little closer.  
Say the words I left behind,  
Before the nights got colder.  

(Final Chorus)  
I'm falling through the rain,  
Calling out your name,  
But the echoes fade into the grey.  
I’m drowning in the past,  
Trying to make it last,  
But some love just slips away...  

(Outro)  
I see your shadow in the silence,  
And I let it fade into the night.
